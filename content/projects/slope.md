  The State and Local Planning for Energy (SLOPE) platform provides energy
  analysis for city and local planners.
---
The beta State and Local Planning for Energy (SLOPE) Platform launched in January 2020, delivering a wealth of energy consumption, efficiency, and renewable energy generation data for state and local governments. The result of a collaboration between the U.S.Department of Energy(DOE) and NREL, SLOPE is a tool to enable more data- driven state and local energy planning by integrating dozens of distinct sources of data and analyses into one easy - to - access online platform. The application is built using a React/Redux front end and a Node.js server. The map components are leveraging Mapbox GL and Google Places API. The charting is done using D3. I contributed largely on the initial scaffolding of the app and component buildout. I also work extensively on the data config side as well as assisting in the geolocation aspects of the map component.
