summary: >-
  Tina is an open source toolkit for building content management directly into
  your website. It's also what is used to manage content on this site!
---
The TinaCMS Toolkit empowers developers to build a visual editing experience directly into their sites. By creating a custom editing experience with Tina instead of opting for a conventional CMS, developers can give their teams a contextual, intuitive editing experience without sacrificing code control.

As a maintainer and contributor of the TinaCMS Toolkit, I worked with the team at Forestry to improve the open source product. This included, but was not limited to, bug fixes and feature development. I helped to integrate the Cloudinary API for asset management in route to the public beta launch for the Tina commercial backend product.
