          I am a frontend focused developer primarily using modern JavaScript
          libraries and frameworks. I enjoy working across the stack to build
          efficient DRY APIs using a wide array of tools.

        text: >-
          I strive to approach my code from the users' perspectives. More often
          than not, friction and lack of velocity stem from a lack of a shared
          mental model. I work with groups to to map concerns in order to shape
          that model.

        title: It's About People
        text: >-
          I believe the web and the tools used to build it are about making the
          world a better place for the people living in it. Regardless of the
          stack, the product, or the company I want to work with amazing
          people.
