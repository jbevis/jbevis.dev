      ## About Me


      Hey There! My name is Jack Bevis and I'm a software developer based in
      Denver, Colorado.


      I am a user focused developer that specializes in building intuitive,
      aesthetically pleasing web applications primarily using Typescript with
      React. My academic background is centered on viewing the world through an
      anthropological and geographical lens. I strive to take this same approach
      to software development and code. The modern web is a ubiquitous element
      in our daily lives and I fully believe access to it is a human right. As
      such I want to use this lens to create tools that a pleasing to use as
      they are to look at.


      I love wilderness and the natural world. I count myself truly lucky to be
      so close to the mountains, desert and general wide open places here in
      Colorado. While I love my home, my wife and I are avid travelers and
      relish any chance to explore a new place in the world. Additionally, I
      love music and playing drums as well as attempting to strum a guitar from
      time to time.


      I greatly appreciate any time spent here to learn a bit more about me and
      please feel free to checkout some of my work [here](/projects), or on my
      [GitHub](https://github.com/jbevis) if you want to go under the hood. You
      can reach me at [jack.bevis@gmail.com](mailto:jack.bevis@gmail.com) and my
      resume can be found
      [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utJWWeY86o000c9efxsnSvWj-KZUZcEcdmy6-ZbOlJ8/edit?usp=sharing).


      Cheers,


      Jack
